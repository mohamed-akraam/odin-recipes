        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lentils, rice and pasta are cooked and then served in a spicy tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>This is a typical Egyptian dish that is very good and cheap over here! Puree the sauce in a food processor if you like a smoother texture</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup brown lentils</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>

            <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the lentils and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 25 minutes. Add the rice to the lentils, and continue to simmer for an additional 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.</li>
            <li>Fill a separate saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned. Pour in the tomatoes and season with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Simmer over medium heat for 10 to 20 minutes.</li>
